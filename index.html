          <p>Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence of
            inflation, which explains how the
            universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big
            Bang 13.8 billion years
            ago.

        <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named
          Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late
          with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
          physics.</p>
        <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
          that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what
          might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the
          presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
          special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
          faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
        <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
          look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
          enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those
          particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
          in the ocean.</p>
        <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew
          a double box around it.</p>
          <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
            they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known
            undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
       
        <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href=#>the first sliver of cosmic time</a>
          with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac
          of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
          fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a
          universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
          trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
          smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
          that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
